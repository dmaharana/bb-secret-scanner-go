Based on the requirements for open-source, free secret scanning tools that reduce false positives and support tracking closure, I’ve evaluated several tools, including GitHound (referenced in your previous query) and others from recent web and X post data. The tools below are selected for their ability to detect secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords, tokens), minimize false positives through advanced techniques (e.g., entropy analysis, context checks), and offer mechanisms to track or manage findings. I’ve also considered integration with workflows to support closure tracking, such as issue creation or reporting. Since you referenced GitHound, I’ll include it and compare it with other tools.

### Key Requirements
- **Open-Source and Free**: Tools must be freely available under an open-source license.
- **Secret Scanning**: Detect sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and tokens in code, commits, or repositories.

Gitleaks is a lightweight alternative for CI/CD, and SecretScanner suits container scans with a dashboard. Test these tools on a sample repository (e.g., https://github.com/BonJarber/SecretsTest) to tune false positives and integrate with your workflow. Let me know if you need help setting up a specific tool or scripting closure tracking!
- add and trigger external tool added as MCP server
- use chromedb (file) to store and retrieve embedding
- chat - accept provider, token and model

- Bitbucket data center
    - this will be a standard golang command line application
    - get a file using REST API from specific project, repository, and commit
    - scan for all possible secret in the file using regex
    - if one or more secrets are found then write the contents into a csv file with headers - project_key, repository_slug, commit_id, commit_date, commit_author, filename, line number
    - this CLI could point to a single file or files in a directory
    - this CLI could also be pointed to the file in the Bitbucket repository, so the contents has to be extracted using appropriate REST API
    - use Bitbucket user's http token as bearer token in all REST API

Attached files are from a secret sanner project that will perform scans on files and identify different types of secrets. This scanner logic has to be modified, if private key is detected then skip other checks on that string as it will other secret types.

Please refine the logic to identify positive secrets from the files https://github.com/BonJarber/SecretsTest/blob/main/main.py and https://github.com/BonJarber/SecretsTest/blob/main/config.py
for example main.py has secrets on line 108, 96, but were not detected
